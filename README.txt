A basic HL1606 LED strip library. This is a fork of the Synoptic LEDstrip library, renamed and with higher level commands.

This library allows you to set individual LED colors (it keeps track of the entire strip's state in RAM), you can set the length of the strip as well.

This library doesn't have any PWM support, its just for primary colors
If you need PWM support, see https://github.com/adafruit/HL1606-LED-Strip-PWM for full-color LED strip control
